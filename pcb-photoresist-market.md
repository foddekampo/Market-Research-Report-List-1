<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PCB Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PCB photoresist market is primarily divided into positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the developer to wash away the exposed areas, creating intricate patterns on the PCB. In contrast, negative photoresists harden upon exposure, making the unexposed areas soluble and leaving behind the desired design after development. Both types play crucial roles in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards, catering to various applications based on their unique properties and processing requirements.</p></p>
