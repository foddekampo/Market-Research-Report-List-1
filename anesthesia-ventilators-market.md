<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthesia Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li><li>Negative Pressure Mechanical Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anesthesia ventilators market comprises two primary types: positive pressure mechanical ventilation and negative pressure mechanical ventilation. Positive pressure ventilators deliver air into the lungs by creating higher airway pressure, commonly used during surgeries to ensure adequate oxygen supply. In contrast, negative pressure ventilators operate by generating a lower pressure around the chest, promoting inhalation through natural atmospheric pressure. Both types play crucial roles in supporting patients' respiratory functions during anesthesia and critical care situations.</p></p>
